# code-runner-POC

This is a small application that demonstrates the functionality in the @codesmith/utils npm package.
It demonstrates how code is run, stopped and tested through the use of custom React Hooks from the library.

The `run test` button runs test in Mocha/Chai. Currently there is only testing in place for `fizzbuzz` 

To spin up the app, clone the repo to your local machine, run `npm i` followed by `npm run dev` and head to `localhost:8080`
